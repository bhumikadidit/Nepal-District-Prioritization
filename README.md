Nepal Education Analysis for UNESCO
What This Project Is About
I created a data analysis project to help UNESCO decide where to invest in girls' STEM education across Nepal. The project identifies which districts need the most help and shows how education investments can create jobs and opportunities for young people.

What I Created
A Complete Dataset - Combined education, employment, and job market information for all Nepal districts

A Priority Scoring System - Developed a special formula to rank districts by how much they need help

Predictive Analysis - Used simple AI to forecast how education investments could reduce unemployment

Interactive Dashboard - Built a visual report in Power BI that shows everything clearly

Technologies I Used
Python - For data cleaning, analysis, and predictions

Pandas - To work with all the data tables

Power BI - To create visual charts and maps

Web Scraping - To collect job market information

Excel - For initial data organization

Key Findings
The analysis shows that these districts need the most urgent attention:

Dolpa - Remote area with very few educational opportunities

Dadeldhura - High unemployment, especially for women

Banke - Growing job market but not enough trained workers

The good news is that investing in STEM education could reduce youth unemployment by 8-12% in most districts within a few years.

How to Use This Project
If you want to explore the results:

Open the Power BI file to see interactive charts and maps

Check the Jupyter notebook to see how the analysis was done

Look at the CSV files to see the raw data

Why This Matters
This project isn't just about numbers - it's about helping real students in Nepal get better education and better jobs. By showing where help is needed most, we can make sure UNESCO's resources create the biggest positive impact.

About Me
